# simple-party-client

This is the front end for a D&D party managment platform.  It is written using vue, vuex, feathers-vuex and vuetify.  I wanted to finish this application, but its hard to be a dungeon master and a developer at the same time.  

This app supports 
 - Users
 - Admins
 - User/character profiles
 - resource tracking
 - Chat
 - Admin resource editing
